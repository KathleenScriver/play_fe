### Learning Objectives

Our goals was to build a personal playlist and song manager. It's currently only intended for one user to keep track of their songs. The user can search an artist from the Nav Bar and a list of songs (retrieved from the MusixMatch API) will be displayed. A user can click on 'favorite' to add that song to their list of favorites. From that favorite, a user can add a song to a specific playlist by clicking 'Add to Playlist'. By clicking on a playlist, the songs within that playlist will be displayed.

**Areas of Focus**
- Using fetch to make API calls
- ES6 and JQuery
- Webpack
- Hosting Webpack app on Heroku
- Pair Programming
- Agile Workflow
